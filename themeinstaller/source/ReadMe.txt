How to Run Themeinstaller:
====================================
- There must not be spaces in the directory names of the path where ThemeInstaller 
is placed.
- If you are using the version that has JRE bundled, use 
./jre1.5.0_12/jre-1_5_0_12-windows-i586-p.exe to install runtime environment.
- After having JRE installed, edit the ThemeInstaller.bat file using a text editor
and set the variable of JRE_BIN_DIR to point to the directory where the java executable
is located at. E.g. before editing the line would look like: 
set JRE_BIN_DIR=".\jre1.5.0_12\bin" 
- After editing the same line could look like (depending on where the JRE has been 
installed): set JRE_BIN_DIR="C:\Program files\Java\jre1.5.0_12\bin"
